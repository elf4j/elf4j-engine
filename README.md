The Java library portion of [elf4j-impl](https://github.com/elf4j/elf4j-impl), where this library will be packaged via
the Java [Service Provider Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html) mechanism
to make a native logging service provider implementation of the [ELF4J](https://github.com/elf4j/) (Easy Logging Facade
for Java) SPI. See [elf4j-impl](https://github.com/elf4j/elf4j-impl) for description.

Although directly implementing the [ELF4J](https://github.com/elf4j/elf4j) API, this POJO library is designed for ease
of adaptation to serve as the engine of any logging API.
