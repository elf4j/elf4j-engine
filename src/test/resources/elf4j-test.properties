### Any level is optional, default to TRACE if omitted
### This override the default global level
level=info
### Global console output stream type, default to stdout; cannot differ per individual writers
#console.out.stream=stderr
### These override level of all caller classes included the specified package
#level@elf4j.impl=error
level@org.springframework=warn
### Any writer is optional, default to a single console writer if no writer configured
writer1=console
### This is the default output pattern, can be omitted
writer1.pattern={timestamp} {level} [{thread}] {class} - {message}
### This would customize the format patterns of the specified writer
#writer1.pattern={timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZZZZZ} {level:5} [{thread:name|id}] {class:simple|full|compressed} - {message}
### Multiple writers are supported, each with its own configurations
writer2=console
#writer2.level=trace
### Default json pattern does not include thread and caller details, and uses minified one-line format for the JSON string
#writer2.pattern={json}
### This would force the JSON to include the thread/caller details
writer2.pattern={json:caller-thread,caller-detail,pretty}
### This would print JSON string in pretty format
#writer2.pattern={json:caller-thread,caller-detail,pretty}
### This would force the writer to use stderr instead of stdout
writer3=console
writer3.pattern={json}
