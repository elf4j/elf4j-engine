### global no-op flag, overriding if set true
#noop=true
### Any level is optional, default to TRACE if omitted
### This override the default global level
#level=info
### These override level of all caller classes included the specified package
level@org.springframework=warn
level@org.apache=error
### Any writer is optional, default to a single standard writer if no writer configured
### Default writer out stream type when omitted at writer level - stdout/stderr/auto, default to stdout. 'auto' means to use stdout if severity level is lower than WARN, otherwise use stderr
stream=stderr
### Overriding default writer pattern (optional)
pattern={timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} {level} {thread} {class:full} - {message}
writer1=standard
### Writer stream type if present overrides global level type. If no stream type configured at either global or writer level, default to stdout
#writer1.stream=auto
### This is the default output pattern, can be omitted
#writer1.pattern={timestamp} {level} [{thread}] {class} - {message}
### Multiple writers are supported, each with its own configurations
writer2=standard
#writer2.level=trace
### Default json pattern does not include thread and caller details, and uses minified one-line format for the JSON string
#writer2.pattern={json}
### This would force the JSON to include the thread/caller details
writer2.pattern={json:caller-thread,caller-detail,pretty}
### This would print JSON string in pretty format
#writer2.pattern={json:caller-thread,caller-detail,pretty}
### This would force the writer to use stderr instead of stdout
writer3=standard
writer3.pattern={json}
writer4=standard
writer4.pattern={timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX} {level:5} [{thread:name}] {class:compressed}#{method}(L{linenumber}@{filename}) -- {message}
### Optional buffer capacity
buffer.front=262144
buffer.back=32768
