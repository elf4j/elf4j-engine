     * To reduce the runtime frequency of walking the call stack in order to locate the caller class, this native ELF4J
     * implementation assumes the owner and caller class to be one and the same. Thus, for logging output that requires
     * just the caller class name, this field will be used in liu of checking the stack trace; i.e. the stack trace
     * walking is needed only when more caller details (e.g. method name, file name, line number) are required.
